# Odin Recipes Project

This is a project I did for the Odin Project. It is essentially a barebones recipe website, featuring three recipes: spaghetti, spicy tuna rolls, and beef shawarma. It helped me demonstrate the following skills: use of file structure, use of img tag with src, width and alt, use of anchor tag with the href and target attributes, use of unordered and ordered lists, and the use of the emphasis tag.
